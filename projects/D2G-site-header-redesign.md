In an effort to modernize the Displays2Go website I lead a project to redesign the site header with the goal of reducing it's footprint, and streamlining critical calls to action (browsing categories, logging in, checking/removing items from the shopping cart).

We identified that sessions that included at least 1 search converted at a much higher rate than sessions that did not. With this in mind we developed a slimmed down "sticky" header that would appear as a user scrolled further down the page. This slimmed down header maintained search functionality as a major call to action.

After implementing the new header, we saw an increase in conversion rates and site searches. We even received direct positive feedback from customers!
