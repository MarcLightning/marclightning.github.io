album-artist: Neck Of The Woods
album-title: The Annex Of Ire
album-description: 'Neck Of The Woods went crazy on this release. In my opinion, an
  almost perfect album full of interesting dynamics, twists, turns and chaos. Brutal
  technicality, flawless mix/master. It was my #1 back in March 2020 and was never
  unseated.'
