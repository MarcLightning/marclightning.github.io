album-title: The Annex Of Ire
album-description: |-
  Neck Of The Woods went crazy on this release. In my opinion, an almost perfect album full of interesting dynamics, twists, turns and chaos. Brutal technicality, flawless mix/master. It was my #1 back in March 2020 and was never unseated.

  Highlight track: Crosshairs Will Shift
