  album-description: |-
    Neck Of The Woods' Annex Of Ire is an almost perfect album full of interesting dynamics, twists, turns and chaos. Brutal, fearless technicality, flawless mixing and mastering put it at #1 for me back in March 2020 and it was never unseated.

  album-title: Old Smoke
  album-description: |-
    Old Smoke is like a kind of bad peyote induced trip across a magical desert on another planet. It's an album that really must be listened to beginning to end. It's a harrowing, exciting, twisting journey that ends in a 13 minute magnum opus that just demands you close your eyes and vibe. It almost took #1 on this list a lot of times. It's so good. Please listen to it.

    Faceless Burial just bring raw, unfettered death metal riffage over and over and it never stops and I love every minute of it.
