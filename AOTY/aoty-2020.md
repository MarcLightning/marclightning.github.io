  album-title: The Annex Of Ire
  album-description: |-
    Neck Of The Woods' Annex Of Ire is an almost perfect album full of interesting dynamics, twists, turns and chaos. Brutal, fearless technicality, flawless mixing and mastering put it at #1 for me back in March 2020 and it was never unseated.

  album-title: Old Smoke
  album-description: |-
    Old Smoke is like a kind of bad peyote induced trip across a magical desert on another planet. It's an album that really must be listened to beginning to end. It's a harrowing, exciting, twisting journey that ends in a 13 minute magnum opus that just demands you close your eyes and vibe. It almost took #1 on this list a lot of times. It's so good. Please listen to it.

  album-title: Speciation
  album-description: |-
    Faceless Burial just bring raw, unfettered death metal riffage over and over and it never stops and I love every minute of it.

  album-title: Unfold The God Man
  album-description: |-
    Unfold The God Man is impeccable progressive metal. While it runs a bit long at over an hour it's full of a variety of styles and dynamics that all flow together really well.

    Madness. Absolute tech death madness. Unfathomable complexity and virtuosity. Brilliant.

  album-title: Visitations From Enceladus
  album-description: |-
    Visitations From Enceladus is an Atheist-esque jazz/prog metal fever dream while spazzing out on a faster than light alien spacecraft. Your first few listens will leave you confused but in the best way possible.

  album-title: Shadow of Life
  album-description: |-
    I am a sucker for good grindcore-y death metal and/or death metal-y grind. I think Shadow of Life finds an almost perfect balance of both while also remaining pretty catchy oddly enough. DO NOT RESUSCITATE.
