  album-title: The Annex Of Ire
  album-description: |-
    The Annex Of Ire was released in March and I listened to nothing else for an entire month. The album is rife with creative riffs, soaring growls, memorable guitar solos, b sections, and breakdowns. I'd argue it has the best mix and master out of any other release. Album of the year for me, juuust edging out Old Smoke.

  album-title: Old Smoke
  album-description: |-
    Old Smoke is like a kind of bad peyote induced trip across a magical desert on another planet. It's an album that really must be listened to beginning to end. It's a harrowing, exciting, twisting journey that ends in a 13 minute magnum opus that just demands you close your eyes and vibe. It almost took #1 on this list a lot of times. It's so good. Please listen to it.

  album-title: Speciation
  album-description: |-
    Faceless Burial just bring raw, unfettered death metal riffage over and over and it never stops and I love every minute of it.

  album-artist: Psychonaut
  album-title: Unfold The God Man
  album-description: |-
    Unfold The God Man is impeccable progressive metal. While it runs a bit long at over an hour it's full of a variety of styles and dynamics that all flow together really well.

  album-title: Visitations From Enceladus
  album-description: |-
    Visitations From Enceladus is an Atheist-esque jazz/prog metal fever dream while traveling through the cosmos on a faster than light alien spacecraft. Your first few listens will leave you confused but in the best way possible.

    Bandcamp: [https://cryptic-shift.bandcamp.com/album/visitations-from-enceladus](https://cryptic-shift.bandcamp.com/album/visitations-from-enceladus "https://cryptic-shift.bandcamp.com/album/visitations-from-enceladus")

    Madness. Absolute tech death madness. Unfathomable complexity and virtuosity. Brilliant.

  album-title: Mara
  album-description: |-
    Mara is just fun. It's fun to listen to. Tight and technical including a lot of (again) fun instrumentation. Every single track has at least 1 or 2 head twisting sections that will throw you for loop, but in a good way.

  album-title: Shadow of Life
  album-description: |-
    I am a sucker for good grindcore-y death metal and/or death metal-y grind. I think Shadow of Life finds an almost perfect balance of both while also remaining pretty catchy oddly enough. DO NOT RESUSCITATE.

  album-artist: Embodiment
  album-title: Palingenesis
  album-description: |-
    Palingenesis is just rock solid technical death metal. Embodiment do a good job balancing the composition of their tracks so that when those heavy bits come they hit hard.

  album-title: Satan is King
  album-description: |-
    Sweet, crunchy, chaotic grindcore. I prefer my grindcore have at least a _modicum_ of audio fidelity and technique. Satan is King fits that bill perfectly.
