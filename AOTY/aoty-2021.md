  album-artist: Alustrium
  album-title: A Monument To Silence
  album-description: |-
    A Monument To Silence is a near perfect blend of progressive metal and tech-death. Alustrium flex their song and riff writing prowess here, weaving provocative (and btbam-esque) ambient movements in between a metric ton of crushing death metal and grind.

  album-title: Mirrors
  album-description: |-
    Mirrors is maybe the angriest, wildest, in your face deathgrind I've heard in years. Positively furious.

  album-title: Impermanence
  album-description: |-
    It's a roller coaster ride through a forest of the catchiest, fastest riffs, blast beats and solos.

  album-artist: Burial In The Sky
  album-title: The Consumed Self
  album-description: |-
    What if Pink Floyd but death metal? That's Burial In The Sky's The Consumed Self. An exemplary progressive effort complete with great technical riffing, captivating atmosphere, and instrumentation (there is an accordion right off the bat, come on now).

  album-title: Famine, Putrid and Fucking Endless
  album-description: |-
    Raw death metal with a bold and fun progressive leaning. Slap bass in the middle of this riff? Why not! Let's pivot this part into some 4 on the floor? Go hog wild!

  album-artist: Epiphanic Truth
  album-title: 'Dark Triad: Bitter Psalms to a Sordid Species'
  album-description: |-
    Dark Triad is a continuous 43 minute work that will take you from furious (and well written) death/black metal all the way to ambient, doom, even a bit of jazz, and all the way back around again. I can't wait to see what more Epiphanic Truth has in store in the future.
