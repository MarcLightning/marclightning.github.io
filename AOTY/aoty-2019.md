    Wow. Woooow. This is the best, tightest, cleanest grind in years. Ferocious, technical and exciting. A 19 minute whirlwind of madness. Bravo.

  album-description: |-
    Flub is...neoclassical technical death metal. Kind of? It's hard to describe this album except that it's addictive and amazing. Flub are fearless with their compositions and instrumentation and honestly I hope they keep making more and weirder stuff.

  album-title: Hidden History of the Human Race
  album-description: |-
    Blood Incantation deftly combine old school death metal and contemporary progressive/tech metal. This album is like you're getting abducted by screaming mind reading aliens, and it should be scary, but it's not, it's awesome.
