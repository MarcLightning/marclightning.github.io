  album-title: No One Knows What The Dead Think
  album-description: |-
    Wow. Woooow. This is the best, tightest, cleanest grind in years. Ferocious, technical and exciting. A 19 minute whirlwind of madness. Bravo.

  album-artist: Blood Incantation
  album-title: Hidden History of the Human Race
  album-description: |-
    Blood Incantation deftly combine old school death metal and contemporary progressive/tech metal. This album is like you're getting abducted by screaming mind reading aliens, and it should be scary, but it's not, it's awesome.

  album-artist: Flub
  album-title: Flub
  album-description: |-
    Flub is...neoclassical technical death metal. Kind of? It's hard to describe this album except that it's addictive and amazing. Flub are fearless with their compositions and instrumentation and honestly I hope they keep making more and weirder stuff.

  album-artist: Tomb Mold
  album-title: Planetary Clairvoyance
  album-description: |-
    Planetary Clairvoyance (alongside Hidden History of the Human Race) marks a return to some of the old school death metal aesthetics and recording styles. Absolutely superb and crushing riffs beginning to end.

  album-artist: In Mourning
  album-title: Garden of Storms
  album-description: |-
    Garden of Storms is simply exemplary melodeath. Emotional, nicely paced, interesting compositions and riffs, and absolutely crushingly heavy when needed.

    Bandcamp: [https://agoniarecords.bandcamp.com/album/garden-of-storms](https://agoniarecords.bandcamp.com/album/garden-of-storms "https://agoniarecords.bandcamp.com/album/garden-of-storms")

  album-artist: Misery Index
  album-title: Rituals of Power
  album-description: |-
    MISERY. FUCKING. INDEX. LET'S GO. Rituals of Power has them improving on that thrash-grind death metal sound and it rules. Listen to New Salem and tell me it doesn't make you want to run through a wall.
