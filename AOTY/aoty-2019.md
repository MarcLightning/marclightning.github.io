  album-title: No One Knows What The Dead Think
  album-description: |-
    Wow. Woooow. This is the best, tightest, cleanest grind in years. Ferocious, technical and exciting. A 19 minute whirlwind of madness. Bravo.

  album-artist: Blood Incantation
  album-title: Hidden History of the Human Race
  album-description: |-
    Blood Incantation deftly combine old school death metal and contemporary progressive/tech metal. This album is like you're getting abducted by screaming mind reading aliens, and it should be scary, but it's not, it's awesome.

  album-artist: Flub
  album-title: Flub
  album-description: |-
    Flub is...neoclassical technical death metal. Kind of? It's hard to describe this album except that it's addictive and amazing. Flub are fearless with their compositions and instrumentation and honestly I hope they keep making more and weirder stuff.

  album-artist: Tomb Mold
  album-title: Planetary Clairvoyance
  album-description: |-
    Planetary Clairvoyance (alongside Hidden History of the Human Race) marks a return to some of the old school death metal aesthetics and recording styles. Absolutely superb and crushing riffs beginning to end.

  album-artist: Venom Prison
  album-title: Samsara
  album-description: |-
    This album just does not stop. I think this could be considered deathgrind? Maybe even...progressive deathgrind? Who cares. It's angry and chaotic and great and brutal.

    Bandcamp: [https://venomprison.bandcamp.com/album/samsara](https://venomprison.bandcamp.com/album/samsara "https://venomprison.bandcamp.com/album/samsara")

    Highlight Track: Uterine Industrialization

  album-title: Interdimensional Invocations
  album-description: |-
    Please listen to this insanity. I'm not sure I know how to even describe it. Equal parts power metal, grindcore, and death metal. Positively absurd and incredible.

    Bandcamp: [https://xoth.bandcamp.com/album/interdimensional-invocations](https://xoth.bandcamp.com/album/interdimensional-invocations "https://xoth.bandcamp.com/album/interdimensional-invocations")

  album-artist: Misery Index
  album-title: Rituals of Power
  album-description: |-
    MISERY. FUCKING. INDEX. LET'S GO. Rituals of Power has them improving on that thrash-grind death metal sound and it rules. Listen to New Salem and tell me it doesn't make you want to run through a wall.

    Bandcamp: [https://miseryindex.bandcamp.com/album/rituals-of-power](https://miseryindex.bandcamp.com/album/rituals-of-power "https://miseryindex.bandcamp.com/album/rituals-of-power")

  album-artist: In Mourning
  album-title: Garden of Storms
  album-description: |-
    Garden of Storms is simply exemplary melodeath. Emotional, nicely paced, interesting compositions and riffs, and absolutely crushingly heavy when needed.

    Bandcamp: [https://agoniarecords.bandcamp.com/album/garden-of-storms](https://agoniarecords.bandcamp.com/album/garden-of-storms "https://agoniarecords.bandcamp.com/album/garden-of-storms")

    Highlight Track: Black Storm

  album-artist: Inanimate Existence
  album-title: Clockwork
  album-description: |-
    Clockwork will have your head spinning. Furious blast beats and virtuosic sections unravel into emotional and soaring choruses. Brilliant.

    Bandcamp: [https://inanimateexistence.bandcamp.com/album/clockwork](https://inanimateexistence.bandcamp.com/album/clockwork "https://inanimateexistence.bandcamp.com/album/clockwork")

  album-artist: KOSM
  album-title: Eyes on the Inside
  album-description: |-
    This is technically an EP but I don't care. KOSM should be way more popular than they are. Dark and brooding and catchy with _insane_ vocals both growled and clean. Also this EP is apparently a concept album about the video game Bloodborne so that's awesome.

    Bandcamp: [https://kosmofficial.bandcamp.com/album/eyes-on-the-inside](https://kosmofficial.bandcamp.com/album/eyes-on-the-inside "https://kosmofficial.bandcamp.com/album/eyes-on-the-inside")
