album-title: Old Smoke
album-description: |-
  Old Smoke is like a kind of bad peyote induced trip across a magical desert on another planet. It's an album that really must be listened to beginning to end. It's a harrowing, exciting, twisting journey that ends in a 13 minute magnum opus that just demands you close your eyes and vibe. It almost took #1 on this list a lot of times. It's so good. Please listen to it.
